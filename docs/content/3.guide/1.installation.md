# Installation

## Server requirements
For Epic Punishments to work, your server need te run at least a 1.17.x server which is Spigot or a Spigot fork, a popular example of this is PaperMC.

## Server installation
Once you have downloaded the latest release of Epic Punishments, It's ready to be put into your server's plugins folder. Make sure to restart your server after doing this.

It's recommended to stop your server before adding the .jar file, but this is not required.

After the server has been restarted you should see a folder called epicPunishments in your plugin folder. This means the installation finished successfully.

## Updating to a new release
First of all, once updating to a new release it's always recommended to back up your data files. Please also check the update message to see if there are any new config options, if so you may need to regenerate the config.yml file or add the options manually.
